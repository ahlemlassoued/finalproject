<h1>PALASTINE</h1>
<p id="paragraph">
    The putative break from hostilities 
    follows waves of Israeli airstrikes on the Palestinian city of Gaza that began on May 10 amid a broader conflict over the eviction of four Palestinian families in East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. As those attacks continued, the rising Palestinian death toll and the destruction of vital infrastructure in Gaza sparked mounting global outrage as well as calls to end the violence. despite the possibility of a respite from the more overt attacks of the last two weeks, Palestinians — who bore the brunt of the casualties and the destruction — are still in need of financial aid, basic resources, and increased international support.

    <h4>PALESTINIANS STILL NEED SUPPORT</h4>
    <img src="need.png" alt="">
    <h4>Here's how to help:</h4>
    <h5>*Donate and Boycott</h5>
    <p>
        There are a number of reputable grassroots organizations you can support that are aimed at ending the Israeli occupation of Gaza and improving the day-to-day lives of Palestinians living in peril. Standouts include The Palestine Child Relief Fund; IF Charity, which distributes funds to families impacted by violence in Gaza; and Doctors Without Borders, an international organization that provides medical treatment to victims.

Another notable movement is Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, also known as BDS. It’s an economic protest, similar to the Montgomery bus boycotts of the civil rights era, that calls for consumers across the world to stop purchasing products from influential companies that have business ties to Israel
    </p>
    <h5>*Amplify Palestinian Voices</h5>
    <p>
        During this time, it is crucial that we make space
         for Palestinian communities to be heard, felt, and understood. We should be especially mindful of the fact that America, a global superpower, has historically played its own insidious role in the decades-long struggle between Israel and Palestine.  
         On social media, make a concerted effort to follow and share Palestinian voices and their experiences. If you’re not sure where to start, some progressive voices include Mohammed El-Kurd, a writer and poet, who has been vocal about his own struggles in Palestine, and Yara Hawari, a feminist advocate who holds a PhD in Middle East Studies and frequently provides vital contextualization on the conflict in Gaza for various media outlets.
         For a more streamlined perspective, you can also follow the “Silenced Voices of Gaza” Twitter list for a collection of tweets from journalists, activists, and humanitarians who are based in Gaza.
        </p>
    <h5>*Shop Palestine</h5>
    <p>
        There are a number of brands and products made by Palestine-based companies and creators that you can buy from directly, helping to support the local Gaza economy. The online marketplace Shop Palestine sells an assortment of products from Palestinian merchants, including hand-woven rugs, ceramics, jewelry, and ships internationally. (Note: They’re currently experiencing a delay in shipments, due to a sudden influx in orders.)

You can also support the wider diaspora. Check in your area to see if there are shops and restaurants owned by Palestinian immigrants or individuals with ties to the West Bank.
    </p>
    <h5>*Read Widely</h5>
    <p>
        One major way to help support Palestinians is to get a more accurate, nuanced view of the current situation and the history behind it. A number of academic studies have exposed the media-biases Western outlets often display when reporting on the Israel-Palestine conflict, whether consciously or unconsciously. As readers become more aware of those biases, they have begun questioning who is best served by traditional “objectivity” best serves. On Thursday, for example, after the Associated Press fired news associate Emily Wilder for publicly sharing her criticisms of Israel’s actions against Palestine, an uproar followed that may not have been quite so loud even a few years ago.

        So how can you ensure you are getting an accurate view of the conflict? Read across multiple outlets. Also, do not rely solely on the day-to-day news cycle to understand the Middle East conflict. Books often offer deeper and more nuanced views on issues. This Penguin Random House reading list is a standout starting point. 
    </p>
    <h5>*Talk with Friends and Family</h5>
    <p>
        Educate others. Conversations with friends and family members can have a powerful effect on personal views and beliefs. Speak with the people close to you about your concern for the people of Palestine and share what you have learned. (Pose star Indya Moore recently modeled what these conversations can look like by hosting an Instagram Live about violence against Palestine.)

The more you talk to people, the more you’ll probably hear a common refrain: “The situation is just so complicated.” Just because something is complicated doesn’t mean we shouldn’t seek to understand it, though. The web resource Decolonize Palestine notes that “an appeal to complexity is also a way to silence your own conscience.” Saying that the situation is complex, in other words, is a way to avoid reckoning with the violence that Palestinians face.

To change the conversation, all of us must challenge and interrogate our biases while holding each other accountable.
